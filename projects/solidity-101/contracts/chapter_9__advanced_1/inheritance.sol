  Inheritance

  Inheritance is a way to extend functionality of a contract.
  Solidity supports both single as well as multiple inheritance.

  Following are the key highlighsts:

  - The contract in Solidity is similar to a Class in C++ - a blueprint for an object.

  - Classes can inherit and so can contracts.

  - Constructor âˆ’ A special function declared with constructor keyword which will be 
    executed once per contract and is invoked when a contract is created.
